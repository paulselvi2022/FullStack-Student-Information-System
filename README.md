## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
    Create Full stack web application using Spring Boot and React. In this video we will use Spring Boot ( MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) with and use React.js to create the frontend application with Material UI and React Hooks( useState, useEffect) with functional components. We will build simple full stack project with RESTful Web services API and also use fetch (you can use axios) for consuming REST API.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You need to install
  *Node.js
  *Java 20
  *MySql Database
  *Intellij IDEA
  *VS Code
  For testing API
  *POSTMAN
  For Design
  *Material UI


### Installing
Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Learn More
You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.
